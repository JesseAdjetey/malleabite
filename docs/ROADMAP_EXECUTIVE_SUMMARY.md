## 💡 **KEY DECISIONS TO MAKE**

### **Before Starting Phase 1:**
- [ ] Should we add recurring events first? (Not in roadmap yet)

- [ ] Mobile web optimization now or wait for Phase 4?

### **During Phase 1:**
- [ ] Which chart library? (Recommendation: recharts)
- [ ] How much ML complexity? (Start simple, expand later)
- [ ] User preferences for auto-scheduling?
